## About Me

My name is Zachary Snarr, and I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell interested in sustainable energy systems, data-driven analysis, and solving technical problems. I enjoy applying engineering principles to understand how real-world systems behave. I’m motivated by work that blends analytical thinking with practical impact, especially in optimizing technologies for a more efficient and sustainable future.

I’m continuing to explore how engineered systems can be made more reliable and efficient. I’m drawn to projects that combine modeling with practical insight, using data to guide real engineering decisions. This perspective shapes how I think about energy, materials, and system behavior, and pushes me toward solutions that balance performance and sustainability. As I advance in my studies, I hope to contribute to technologies that improve how energy and mechanical systems serve society.
